# bkSQL

bkSQL will auto-backup your remote DataBases.

## Getting Started

This is a **NetBeans IDE 8.2** - **Java project**, for **Windows** users. <br />

bkSQL will create backup configurations for you to manually or automatically backup your remote DataBases. <br />
It uses [MySQLDump](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqldump.html), .bat files (converted to .exe, for security reasons), .xml, and more. <br />

You need to enter some info, like **Host**, **User**, **Password**, **DB** to backup, the **Path** to save backup files and **Loggedin User Password** (Optional).
You can easily configure a **Schedule** to auto-backup, setting up the time/hour and "repeat rate".

You can visualize and delete specific backup configuration or delete all.
