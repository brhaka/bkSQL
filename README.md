# bkSQL

bkSQL will auto-backup your remote DataBases.

You need to enter some info, like **Host**, **User**, **Password**, **DB** to backup, the **Path** to save backup files and **Loggedin User Password**.
After that, you can easily configure a **Schedule** to auto-backup, setting up when and the "repeat rate".
