# bkSQL

bkSQL will auto-backup your remote DataBases.

You need to enter some info, like **Host**, **User**, **Password**, **DB** to backup, the **Path** to save backup files and **Loggedin User Password** (Optional).
After that, you can easily configure a **Schedule** to auto-backup, setting up the time/hour and "repeat rate".

You can visualize and delete specific backup configuration or delete all.

This is a **NetBeans IDE 8.2** - **Java project**.
Feel free to make improvements to bkSQL.
